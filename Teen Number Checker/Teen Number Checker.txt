Teen Number CheckerWe'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).Write a method hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if one of parameters isin range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:-> hasTeen(9, 99, 19); should return true since 19 is in range 13 - 19-> hasTeen(23, 15, 42); should return true since 15 is in range 13 - 19-> hasTeen(22, 23, 34); should return false since numbers 22, 23, 34 are not inrange 13-19
